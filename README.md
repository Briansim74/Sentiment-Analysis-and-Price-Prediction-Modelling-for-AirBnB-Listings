# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Price-Prediction-Modelling-for-AirBnB-Listings
A Machine Learning Approach to Sentiment Analysis and Price Prediction Modelling for AirBnB Listings

<br/>In this notebook, we will discuss how to accurately predict whether an AirBnB listing overrated or underrated by 
<br/> using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict an AirBnB listing's price  
and comparing it with its actual price to find if the listing is over or under-priced.

<br/> In addition, we will make use of Sentiment Analysis from the reviews of AirBnB listings to determine if the listing
<br/> garners favourable or negative sentiments, and together with the price prediction, conclude if the AirBnB listing
<br/>is overrated or underrated.

<br/>In this folder is the Complete Prediction Notebook, which is named Final Project Notebook. To ensure consistency, it is suggested to pre-load the current files and models we have processed and/or trained. In addition, large files have been compressed and to viet them, it is suggested to unzip all the files uploaded. The final output of this Notebook, which is called 7. final_sentiment.csv, will not be uploaded as its file size is too large, but this file may be created by following the notebook along.

<br/>We have used the Boston AirBnB listings from the Kaggle Dataset, which includes:

1. calendar.csv
2. listings.csv
3. reviews.csv

We have 7 processed files, which include:

1. cleaned_listing.csv
2. predicted_prices.csv
3. sample_reviews.csv
4. sample_reviews_labelled.csv
5. sample_changed_reviews.csv
6. sample_changed_reviews_labelled.csv
8. airbnb_prediction.csv

We have 3 pre-trained models, which include:

1. airbnb_pycaret.pkl
2. airbnb_keras folder
3. word2vec.model

<br/>This notebook was done together with my fellow group members - Jovon Lim, Samuel Ang and Jin Yong He - for our Final Project of E178 Statistics and Data Science Module in UC, Berkeley.
