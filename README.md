A Machine Learning Approach to Sentiment Analysis and Price Prediction Modelling for AirBnB Listings

<br/>In this notebook, we will discuss how to accurately predict whether an AirBnB listing overrated or underrated by 
<br/> using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict an AirBnB listing's price  
and comparing it with its actual price to find if the listing is over or under-priced.

<br/> In addition, we will make use of Sentiment Analysis from the reviews of AirBnB listings to determine if the listing
<br/> garners favourable or negative sentiments, and together with the price prediction, conclude if the AirBnB listing
<br/>is overrated or underrated.

<br/>This notebook was done together with my fellow group members - Jovon Lim, Samuel Ang and Jin Yong He for the Final Project of E178 Statistics and Data Science Module in UC, Berkeley.
