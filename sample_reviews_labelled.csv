rather two stayed upper room though nobody house except one guest staying also upper level islam sent u email stay couldnt see didnt computer u use smartphone however told u stay basement booking made upper room sure wanted u stay basement room bed basic could told u stay room upstairs fact owner wasnt made strange feeling back door kitchen locked luggage house didnt got told put bar across kinda close sliding door felt unsafe anybody could walking easily made way thing went fine end definitely recommend place unless owner looking cheap place stay dont mind inconvenience like part boston great city fun ,"communication with islam and his brother was good. however, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. at this point, we were totally disgusted. we went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. we managed to speak with islam brother. he fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm. 

the house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. we were supposed to be on the basement, which i really don't recommend. bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. we stayed in the upper room, as we though we were there. nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level. 

islam sent us an email during our stay, which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. however, he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic, when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!

the fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. the back door in the kitchen were not locked at all, while our luggage was in the house. we didn't got told at all. we had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.

all in all, things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. if you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience, then you will like it.

we managed to get the key from the lock box easily which was nice because it provided flexibility for whatever time we arrived. this place is extremely close to the airport. i've never stayed next door to the airport before. less than a 5 min ride to airport station which was then a 5 min walk.

place had everything. felt very homely like staying at a friends. location was amazing!! east boston has some hidden gem restaurants and proximity to airport subway station was key. no complaints about the room or bathroom.

reluctant to give negative feedback i felt that izzi is running an operation here that is not consistent with my values, and what i believe are the implicit values of the airbnb ""community.""

the host actually does not live in the place, rather he lives out of state and has some caretaker changing the sheets and keeping the place clean. so in essence the place is a low security hotel or hostel - except with no management present to deal with any contingencies that might come up between guests. given that there is shared intimate space the proprietor is relying on the generally good character of the ""airbnb community"" to make sure that nothing untoward occurs. chances are that nothing untoward will occur, but it is an exposure.

what i also feel is happening in this sort of operation is that it is a business being run in a residential area - compromising the coherency of the neighborhood and riding on the infrastructure of legitimate hotels  (who pay hotel taxes, liability insurance, employment taxes, and other commercial fees) while not paying for the infrastructure that these taxes and fees pay for.

this is america, where entrepreneurial enterprise is rewarded. but this is also america where this can mean concentrating enterprise efforts on profit centers, and externalizing cost centers. the impacts of that externalization do not decrease the costs, they just end up in someone else in-basket.  my sense of conviviality eschews externalizing costs to the expense of the neighborhood or local businesses.",-558.3194831,0,0

the only problem with the house is that there is only one bathroom for 4 rooms, so it's kind of bothering when everyone wants to shower in the morning.

quick walk through the park. on our first night we met friends for dinner and after dropping off our things, i noticed a sign on the park gates saying 'closed at 11 pm'. we had a bit of a rush to make it back in time and got off the t at 10.56! i am not sure how observant they are of the park closing times, but it's something to keep in mind. the basement room was clean, comfortable and private, which i appreciated. having one bathroom for a house with 4 bedrooms meant that there was often a wait for the shower/ toilet, but we managed. there were plenty of boston brochures and maps about the house for guests to use, which was handy, great to help us decide how to use our three days in town. the house was clean and welcoming, with the hand towel and bath mat seemingly changed daily. the shower did need a bit of a clean though the rest of the bathroom as spotless. we could have done with a towel rail or some kind of hooks on which to hang our towels in our room. otherwise despite the heat, they could be slow to dry. we loved the fact it wa just 3 stops from the action, so getting in in the morning and home at night was such a simple and quick process. very happy withour

we were able to use the kitchen facilities for breakfast and our evening meal and we also used their washing machine and dryer.

the 12 minute walk to the train station was fine in the day - we didn't come home after dark so can't make a comment on that. the location was not quite as we'd expected .   

there weren't many restaurants in close proximity although there were a couple of convenience stores close by.  ",-208.6170734,0,1

u particularly bigtall may comfortable someone larger stature said found apartment phenomenal would definitely love stay place great christian also ideal host didnt get meet person pleasant communication quick respond question even went extra mile offering u detailed recommendation favorite spot near apt around boston thank christian accommodating making first airbnb experience great one ,"i planned this trip to boston as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and christian's apartment was absolutely perfect for us! the location is so convenient to everything.  we had two events to attend at td garden and we were able to walk over there in only  about 10-15 minutes.  to get anywhere else we jumped on the t just up the street from the apartment which made things so easy.  
as for the apartment itself, it was very cozy and gave us the feel of what it would be like to live in the city.  we have no complaints whatsoever although, i do feel it's worth noting that the staircase in the building is narrow and steep and the bathroom is also very small since the building is old.  we found the historical feel of the building cool but neither of us is particularly big/tall so it may not be as comfortable for someone of larger stature. that being said, we found the apartment to be phenomenal.  we would definitely love to stay there again.
not only was the place great, christian was also the ideal host.  we didn't get to meet him in person but he was so pleasant through all our communication, was quick to respond to any questions i had, and even went the extra mile by offering us detailed recommendations for his favorite spots near the apt and around boston.  
thank you christian for being so accommodating and making our first airbnb experience a great one!!     ",159.4746538,1,1

i would stay there again but future guests should be aware that:

1.  the wifi is a pain... it kicks you off every hour or so and you have to completely log back in again via your email address and a password.  seems really unnecessary.

2.  the 2nd bedroom does not have any sort of heating or cooling.  so in order to keep it somewhat cool (in summer) you have to leave the door open and the window (there is a strange window between the 2nd bedroom and the living room) open.  not a problem in many situations for families but we were two couples and it made the sleeping arrangements a bit awkward.  it is much better than just a sleeper couch in the living room, but effectively not as private as you would expect from a 2nd bedroom.  but given the old nature of the building and the location of the 2nd bedroom, there's not an easy fix for the owner,

again, don't let the two issues above deter you... we had a great stay and the location is amazing.

the kitchen is like something out of an eastern european flat. so cramped you can barely fit between the counter and the stove. you can only open the fridge door a quarter of the way. but it does have a gas stove. 
the bathroom has cracked plaster in the shower area and the shelf in the shower is mildewed with the laminate wood coming up. 
our alarm clock in the morning consisted of the garbage truck at 5:45 am picking up the dumpsters outside our window (which was gone through every couple of hours through the night by street people). then from 7:00 until just after 8:00 we got to hear the loud music of the neighbor while they got ready for the day.

the flat was located in an excellent location and my friends and i could even walk to downtown from there though the subway will definitely be quicker. but if you are looking to soak in the sights, walking is a good choice. the walk too us through boylston street, which i guess is one of the shopping belts in boston given the number of shops and restaurants there.

around the corner from the t stop and boston university and across the park from northeastern. it was also a less than 15 minute walk to the mfa and the isabella stewart gardner, which were two of our must-sees. several decent restaurants (check out el pelón) and a grocery store nearby. i felt like the listing experience was accurate and sean was super accommodating about possible bag storage issues. key pick up was smooth. studio covers the basics and would be a good option for such grad school visits, or people who wanted to focus on the art museums. 

the biggest negatives about the stay were not things in his control. the first is that at 3am on saturday morning some (likely) drunk (likely) undergraduate idiot went through and continuously buzzed through all of the apartments for about fifteen minutes and the second is that on monday morning the garbage truck is literally right outside your window before seven in the morning. which was so loud my boyfriend could hear it through his silicone earplugs (although he couldn't hear the the apartment buzzer so they're probably still worth bringing).",-81.15077515,0,1

the negatives were, we arrived at 3pm with check in time being after 12pm we thought we would be fine. sean was there cleaning the room when we arrived which was no big deal. what bothered me was it looked like someone had either urinated in the sheets or spilled something because there was a pile of the dirty sheets with a huge wet spot; that grossed me out.

the room was basic, and worked for a night. i think possibly we might just be old for such an experience. i am in my mid 30s and used to staying in decent hotels. if i was in my early 20s would have been totally fine with the place.

i guess i was trying to get a bargain and you basically get what you pay for. the room was clean enough, great location but i would opt to pay more for a nicer place.",-538.2834826,0,0

pros
-very cheap place to stay
-this property is a five minute walk to fenway
-the wifi is super fast
-the water is hot

cons
-everything else

let me be clear:  this place met our needs for the ""guy weekend"", which was to spend as much time at fenway as we possibly could.  we were very appreciative of the short walk to the park, and the fast wifi.  but, the apartment was basically a room with two mattresses on the floor, a tiny bathroom and a very, very tiny kitchen.  the air conditioner was underpowered, we could hear the footsteps of the people above us, and the garbage truck emptied the three dumpsters outside our window at 5:55 am on saturday morning. 

in addition, the host could have spent a hundred dollars on some functioning pillows, maybe a wash cloth or two, and some blankets for the second bed....

sean was a little hard to reach with instructions, but i don't fault him too much for it as he did say he had been travelling. 

short version:  if you have a serious limit to your budget and want to spend your money and time on other things -- particularly fenway -- and you don't care for much more than a mattress with some air conditioning and fast wifi, then this is your spot.   

if, however, you want anything coming close to creature comforts, then you should move on and find something else. 

i wish i was able to be more charitable, but unfortunately this is the reality of this property. ",-658.4321909,0,0

u since say 1 4 people arrived bed seemed quite small asked sean told 2 mattress top take apart thought sheet closet explored boston day didnt return til 1 ampulling mattress apart wanted tired since 1 sheet decided cozy bed comfortable slept well around 5 people alley going glass bottle trash dumpster loud sure happens time kitchen small would helpful needed one would recommend 4 people stay would quite cramped looking budget place great viewthis would work ,i fell in love with the view of this apartment. fenway out the window as promised. my expectations were pretty low going in because i realized it was very basic budget accommodations. sean was helpful with the different questions i had about the city. the instructions for obtaining lockbox key were very clear. the location is great and the building old and had a lot of character. i came to town with a friend of mine for the night to catch the red sox game. we understood it to have a large enough bed to accommodate us since it says 1 to 4 people. when we arrived the bed seemed quite small. when i asked sean about it he told me that there was 2 mattresses on top of each other and to take them apart and he thought that there were sheets in the closet for both  ( there were not) we had explored boston all day and didn't return til 1 am..pulling a mattress apart was not what i wanted to do. we were so tired and since there was only 1 sheet we decided to just be very cozy. the bed was comfortable and we slept well until around 5 am when people were down in the alley going through glass bottles in the trash dumpsters which was very loud. (not sure if that happens all the time) the kitchen is small but would be helpful if you needed one. i would not recommend having 4 people stay as it would be quite cramped ( but if you are looking for a budget place with a great view..this would work.  ),-730.6932188,0,1

i defer to ian's june 2015 review. he nailed many of the issues i had with the rental. the apt is extremely small. it's an old, run down building. stacked up mattresses. the place was very warm and stuffy. the a/c is underpowered. peeling paint on ceiling. oldish bed linens and towels. no wash cloths. had to search for toilet paper. the place smelled. floor was sticky. stove had grime on burner. the sense of customer service was non-existent.

actually worked better cooled whole room nicely slept great ac unit help drown noise outside window u would definitley stay husband needed place stay whole family 2 kid think could fit fine might chose somewhere little bigger perfect though place crash night town,"my husband and i stayed at sean's place in order to see a show at the house of blues.  it was a perfect place for us to crash and we could see the hob from the bay window of his studio appartment!  sean was an incredibly easy to reach and communicate with host.  the instructions to find the key lockbox ere clear and presice.  we had absolutely no trouble getting into the apartment.  we commincated through the airbnb site and it was flawless.  i did have his cell number just in case but never needed it.  
appartment was cozy and had everything we needed, just like the listing indicates.  don't go in expecting luxuryl; we didn't and were very comfortable staying here for one night.  it's true what other reviewers said about city noises at night and in the early morning.  we were prepared for this and it was understandle and fine.  i'd like to contradict what other said about the room never cooling down.  when we were here, it was a hot day and night (80s in day, high 60s at night).  the a/c window unit was great if kept at the low setting.  we tried to crank it to high but when we came home after the show the apartment was stuffy.  so i put it back to low and it actually worked better and cooled the whole room nicely.  i slept great!  and the a/c unit helps drown out any noise outside the window, which for us was just a few.  i would definitley stay here again with just my husband.  if i needed a place to stay with my whole family (we have 2 kids) think we could all fit fine but i might chose somewhere a little bigger.  perfect though for a place to crash for a night on the town!",-673.4151973,0,1

bed toilet problem however want comfortable cozy apartment relax long day might perfect fit ,"this is a tough place to review.

on the plus side -cost and location: the price is amazingly cheap. boston's hotel market is insanely expensive. any hotels in the area are likely almost double the cost. also, the place is in a great neighborhood. we went to a red sox game and fenway is just a few blocks away. there are tons of great restaurants and museums and other things to do within walking distance.

communication with sean was good. when we first arrived there was an issue with the key that was neither our fault or his, and he worked really hard to remedy the problem.

the negatives: we stayed four nights and i was just getting over a cold (not a great way to start a vacation) and this place is really just not that comfortable. it is basically a college student's studio apartment - no tv, no couch, no decor, beat up old towels and pillows, small bathroom and tight kitchen. wifi worked great. for a night or two this would have been no problem, but by the fourth night it was a bummer to have to come back to after dinner. if i was feeling better and we were enjoying boston's night life more, this would not have been an issue.

so, this place is perfect if you want a cheap place in a great neighborhood. if you just need a roof, a bed and a toilet, then there are no problems. however, if you want a comfortable, cozy apartment to relax in after a long day, then this might not be a perfect fit.  ",-205.3649897,0,0

the cons i would say is that the apartment needs to have a makeover.

you're going for a weekend, especially if you are going to see the sox play, this is a fantastically convenient & affordable place to stay.

pros: 
1. what you see is what you get. other than minor details, i knew exactly what this space would look like. it's not the lap of luxury, but that isn't what i paid for nor what i expected.
2. cost. i couldn't find a hotel room, in a comparable location, for less than $180/night
3. location. fenway is literally the next street over. many bars, restaurants, & other sights/attractions within walking distance, or using the easy access to mass transit. uber is an easy pickup in front. there is also a target, cvs, & grocery store within walking distance. 
4. access. easy instructions to get the keys & i was thankful it was on the 1st floor
5. communication. sean was easy to contact, communicate with, & quickly responsive

cons:
1. noise. because of all of the bars nearby, there was a lot of late night / early morning foot traffic that was loud & obnoxious drunks. early morning trash pickup is very loud. unlike others, i didn't hear any neighbors, so that was nice.
2. wood slats under mattress move easily, resulting in spots that droop & are uncomfortable. we had to reset the slats a few times over the 9 days we were there. other than that, unlike what others have written, the mattresses were better than i expected.
3. towel racks would be nice, & more than one roll of toilet paper would've been appreciated.
4. the heat was overbearing. we actually had to keep the windows open, in the heart of winter, to combat the stifling heat.

overall, i would jump at the chance to stay here again. the 4 cons were minor inconveniences compared to everything this place has to offer. having stayed as long as we did, the angry reviews seem strange/petty & i question whether those folks actually looked at the description before they went.",-906.8102312,0,1

really need fresh paint floor good scrub,"overall, we are not satisfied with this accommodation. we’d expect a lot more for the money we spent and would not recommend it!

pro:
+ good communication, friendly and fast responses 
+ keys were easy to find. sean found a flexible solution so you don’t have to wait for the host to hand you the keys so you can arrive whenever you like.
+ location of the apartment was okay for us, we reached everything we wanted in little distance by bike or public transportation
+ linings and towels were fresh and clean
+ wifi was good

contra:
- lack of hygiene (insect killer in the kitchen and mouse traps in every room give you an idea)
everything we took out of the cabinets was greasy and dirty you don’t wanna cook there, the kitchen trash had not been taken out and smelled disgusting, crumbs in the toaster oven, old urine stains on the toilet, bathtub has not been cleaned either
- also, you should be really close with your co-travellers, since you won’t be able to close the bathroom door all the way. there’s a screw missing (that could be fixed easily) and keeps the door hanging loose and scratching over the floor
- bathtub drain was clogged 
- you can clearly hear (and smell) the neighbors through the walls. i guess there a lot of young students living in this building. don’t stay there if you like it quiet and private.
- all in all the apartment is anything but nice and cozy. the walls could really need some fresh paint and the floors a good scrub",-598.2816158,0,0

disappointing on both counts.  it was very difficult to communicate with the host.  it wasn't until i texted, emailed and called that i got directions for entry.  upon our arrival, i had to locate the key away from the building in a lock box attached to a random chain link fence.  that was my first red flag.  upon entry, the house was filthy.  literal piles of dust and dirt in the corners, which may not be so bad under normal circumstances, but both beds were mattresses on the floor, so we we were up close and personal with the dirt.  there were not enough linens, or towels. there was only a fitted sheet and a duvet that was much too hot!  no top sheet or blankets.  no hand towels or wash cloths.  the shower had a pile of partially used soap.  no coffee maker or blender.  all of this was the second red flag.  the clincher was when i came home and found a letter from the landlord explaining that airbnb was not legal in the building.  by then, i was very uncomfortable.  when i asked the host about the letter, he dismissed it saying he gets letters like that all the time.  the location was great, and i did expect small and old (which is was), but dirty, illegal, and understocked - not good!",-777.7630746,0,0

property review one property fenway area,"we were disappointed with this listing. i am from boston and so am very familiar with the city, and my wife and i have stayed in airbnbs across the world, so hopefully our comments will be helpful to other travelers. 

we were most surprised at the lack of basic cleanliness of the studio apartment. easily removable dust was along the walls, floors, under the bed, etc, and partially used soaps were scattered in the bathroom; meanwhile the presence of a mousetrap behind the bathtub made us fear the worst (luckily, we had no rodent surprises!). the one lamp in the bedroom did not work. we initially thought a cleaning had not been done prior to arrival, but the host assured us it had. the bathroom door does not close, even when pushed/held, severely limiting privacy. we didn't use the kitchen, which was just as well since the fridge can only barely open given the cramped space. the toilet did not work consistently.

i was also surprised when i got a call a few hours later from another of the host's guests staying at a different property asking to switch keys. not only had the host shared my contact information with this person without my permission, he also expected us to resolve the issue between ourselves, which took time away from my plans in boston. meanwhile, i'm still confused as to why one key is able to open 2 different buildings; the host offered no explanation. this seems like an important security issue.

finally, i was surprised when i received the welcome note from the host stating that i should not mention to anyone that we were using airbnb at this property (as he put it, ""loose lips sink ships.""). we were disappointed by this secrecy and would prefer staying in places that are legally sanctioned for airbnb use.

on the upside, we did appreciate that the host was flexible in our departure time, and for sure the location of the property, in the heart of fenway, was very desirable. 

in re-reviewing the comments from other guests of this host, it seems clear that this host operates airbnb at several properties (fenway, beacon hill, other?) across the city, so future potential guests should note that all listed comments likely do not apply to all properties. this review is for one of the properties in the fenway area.",-1342.06077,0,0

courtney had cancelled our reservation a couple of days before the trip due to flooding in her apt - very understandable. the description of the work and floor did not seem as dangerous as it was. there were uneven, ripped up floors, ragged wood shards & exposed nails. there were building materials and ripped up carpeting in the living spaces. we were traveling with a 2 and 1/2 year old so this was very dangerous. we had to put blankets down to walk around. 
the main issue with the apartment was the cleanliness. every appliance was dirty. splattered food was in the freezer, refrigerator, microwave. animal hair on the counters, pubic hair in the bathroom. the toilet hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. grease/butter/filth smeared on all doors of appliances. we had to clean just to stay. our son i believe dropped a chip on the floor and husband accidentally tripped on the floor and broke a glass. (which we will pay for). this is not a comfortable space when we stayed.  we are working now on a refund.",-855.7032088,0,0

hair side bed pillow thing thrown floor like didnt even clean room paid couple hundred found much better place childish behavior host pain write review fellow host would want anyone else fooled staying ,"i was very excited for my stay here and it could not have been more of a disaster. it was not accurately represented in the listing. the home was very old and the space was not clean. the neighborhood was sketchy. this place would be possibly fine for someone in their teens or early 20s. after staying one night here, i was able to move out per approval by airbnb. the girls then proceeded to send me a passive aggressive, rude text message after i had left. they thought i locked one of their cats in the attic...i didnt even know there was an attic and the only cat i ever saw was the one that wouldn't leave my bed. i was left on the streets with 3 bags in the rain on my first night in boston because i just could not stay there any longer. cat food on the floor, a mess in the sink and in fridge...dirty dishes, dirty spoons laying around with cat food on them. the bedroom was riddled with photos of random girls. i felt like i was sharing a room with someone else. the home was old and dark and seemed to be a large house divided up so many times that there were possibly dozens of people under one roof. when i arrived, there were about 6 boys in their early 20s drinking topless outside the door. felt like a frat party. also this unit has a shared bathroom thats not near your bedroom, and your bedroom would be right in the living room. very small space. the girls were out of town when i arrived and did not leave me with the internet code or any information but one towel full of cat hair on it. on the other side of the bed, there were pillows and things just thrown on the floor. its like they didn't even clean the room. i paid a couple hundred more and found a much better place for me.... with no childish behavior from the host. pains me to write this review as a fellow host myself but i would not want anyone else to be fooled into staying here.

with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! they were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. the apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! it was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. the apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen tvs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). we all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. the neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. this was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar

back.  wasn't too in your business.  didn't have very strict ""time-in"" requirements.  he was just a very chill dude with a very convenient south boston location that you can walk to pretty much anywhere from, had a lot of amazing insights into the local area and it's history, the culture, the people there, etc..  really, this is the sort of place you stay at if you really want to get to know the place you are visiting and going beyond the atypical tourist guidebook of things to do.  his price is also among the best in the city, especially considering that he does go above and beyond what most hosts (at least from my experience) do to leave their guests satisfied.  as for the actual room provided?  you get a huge tv with internet access to netflix (accessed through a computer) and a hard and a soft futon to sleep on, pretty much what you see in that picture.  this is by no means luxurious but it gets the job that it needs done done: give the guest a place to sleep.  i didn't have much problem getting to sleep most nights that i was there.  really, the lodging amenities matter very little compared to the hospitality of the host, the area around it, the people in that area, all of the sights within walking distance, and just the overall experience.  this is not the place to stay if you are one of those folks who likes to check into 20 story hotel and then pick up a tourist

longer review: before we arrived, lisa was great with communication. she responded quickly (we had to book pretty close to the date) and she was able to get us in very fast. she was really sweet too by letting us check in a little early. when we arrived, there was amble free street parking and we noticed it was very very close to the t (only a 5-10 minute walk). 

inside, the home is beautiful and very clean. the bed was sooooo comfy and the room provided us with everything we needed. lisa was extremely friendly and helpful with getting around boston. we had brought food with us, and being able to use the kitchen was awesome! they let us store food in the fridge and we made sure to clean everything we used. 

we even hung out with lisa and brian (her husband) a bit!

comfortably. room was very clean. aircon and heating worked well (weirdly, we needed both!!). parking wasn't too hard, even my parallel parking phobic husband was able to get drive in spots without too much of a bother. the charlie cards were a huge bonus, and given the house is literally at a bus stop, and a very short walk to the orange line, we used them all the time. very easy to get into the city- most of the main stops are on the one line, and because the house is on the last stop, it's simple getting home too. the shower is lovely and super hot, and kitchen had all the basic cooking gear you needed for a night in. wifi was very quick and we never had any issues with dropping in or out. it is more of a boarding house than description suggests- apart from a private section out back, all the other rooms (two floors in one house) are guest rooms, which was a little disconcerting for boarding newbies like us. still, there are two bathrooms and we only really had to wait a few

the bonus feature of the stay with lisa was the charlie cards she provides. they gave us unlimited access to  the very convenient public transportation system. catching the bus was right across the street. getting to downtown boston was easy to navigate and there are always friendly people around to help with directions if needed. we usually had less than a 6 minute wait for the next bus or train and never more than 10 minutes.

location) it is super nice place. to travel in boston, it's very close to the bus stop (#39, under 5 min to walk ) and subway(orange line, green line). i had a big luggage but it wasn't hard at all to come to this apt. 
host) i asked audrey to checkin earlier becuase i needed to move from another apt to this apt. very kindly, she changed my checkin time after communicating with the guest checking out on that day. after checkin, i haven't seen her so it was very privacy. also she gave me a list of nice restaurants and it really worked! and when i asked how to use hot water to audery, she answered very fast with text message or e-mail. nothing bothered me. i very appreciate audrey and her husband.
apt) it's surper nice. if i come back, i'll choose this apt again for sure. everything is in the apt. in the kitchen, microwave, refrigerator, coffe maker, clean spoon, knife, fork, dishes, bowl... so i could enjoy meal in the apt sometimes. in the bedroom, nice bed!!! it's big enough to use for me and my friend. closet was in it so i put my clothes on in. in the restroom, i could take a shower with hot water, also it was poosible to use washer. wifi is working with good speed. and this apt is well interiored, so it would give perfect memory in boston.

apartment in boston! the apartment is comfortably furnished and gets a lot of sunlight, which is something i always appreciate when away from home. it's located in a very convenient part of the city, and, since weather was so wonderful while i was in town, i took full advantage and walked everywhere. almost everything i needed was in walk distance -- trader joe's, the archives at boston university, cute cafes -- and for everything else, the orange and green lines were easy to catch. the building itself is also very quiet, and while there was a little bit of noise outside during the weekend due to college students walking by, i fully expected that and wasn't bothered; it's no more than what you would expect when you're in a major city. 

christina and steven were fantastic hosts; they knew i had luggage with me so arranged to let me check in a bit earlier and check out a bit later as well. they also checked in with me partway through my six day stay to make sure everything was going well and to see if they could be of help in any way.

overall, i had a great time and would happily return should i find myself in boston again. thank you, christina and steven!",92.60500937,1,1

dirty carpet top dirty burned light bulb bathroom one bathroom sink didnt drain one window blind fell opened carbon monoxide detector chirped constantly elevator broken making loud noise keeping u night fixed day 3 stay wanted move pain decided live emailed seamless 3 time apartment filth issue apartment never received reply thats 6 total email without reply would never rent ,"while others have had great experiences with seamless, ours was unfortunately not a good one.

we booked a different apartment, but were informed the day before move in that the original apartment had a plumbing problem so we were moved into this one. but that was only after i called to ask why we didn't have move in instructions yet (i'd sent 3 emails asking where the move in instructions were with no reply).  

this apartment had had a long term renter in it that moved out the day before we arrived.  seamless' cleaning crew worked on it all day and when we arrived it appeared clean on the surface, so we moved in.  once we were in though we started to see just how dirty it was.  filthy.  old food stuck in the kitchen, food stuck in the kitchen sink, sticky spots on the floor, dirty furniture, dirty carpet.  on top of being dirty there was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom, one of the bathroom sinks didn't drain, one of the window blinds fell off when we opened it, the carbon monoxide detector chirped constantly, the elevator was broken (making a loud noise) keeping us up at night (they fixed that on day 3 of our stay). we wanted to move, but it was such a pain we decided to live with it.

i emailed seamless 3 times while we were in the apartment about the filth and the issues with the apartment and never received a reply.  that's 6 total emails to them without a reply.  i would never rent from them again.

not for people who:
- like soft beds
- are against veloured towels
- can't sleep with bird or other noises (heavy door that slams when people enter the building) 
- want to meet the owner

perfect for people who:
- need to take the t (green line, st. mary's stop) 
- want to be perfectly in the middle of downtown boston and other areas (coolidge for example)
- want an easy check in and check out

surprise surely visit boston seafood show definitely stay apartment available ,"george was very prompt on his reply to my messages. 

i actually didn't know that george was living on the same apartment but it was cool.  george is a very nice guy. we talked for a while but he had to leave right away to catch a flight. 

checking in and out was very fast.  he told me to take the free bus ride from airport to the city. the bus ride took about 10 minutes and from the bus station, i just walked about 5 minutes to the apartment.

 the apartment was very clean and the room has a very nice view of fish port and sea. lots of restaurants around and a nearby grocery and convenience store too. 

wifi has very strong signal whether inside the room or the living room. it was so nice to work on the living room because of the great view. 

what you see in the pictures are accurate. the bed was very comfortable and both the room and living room have cable tv.  

the washroom was very clean. one thing i must tell george is to replace his bath towel. the one i used had a big hole. but i am a guy so it wasn't a big issue.. but if his guest was a female, might be an issue.

i also received a nice gift from george on my second night. he left a gift certificate on the table from one of the restaurants that he manages. thank you so much for the nice gesture. i enjoyed my dinner.

the residents living in this apartment were very nice and courteous. this is a pleasant surprise to me.

i will surely visit boston again because of the seafood show. i will definitely stay in this apartment again if available.

isolation house insufficient light sleeper like might find difficult sleep hear everything room especially noisy traffic also curtain blind white transparent summer get bright really early ,"this place is like a student house. we stayed in a room and shared the kitchen and the bathrooms with 3 more groups of people, some of which live there as tenants. the room itself is spacious enough for a couple and perhaps a small child. bedsheets and towels were clean and fresh. perhaps also because we arrived on a monday and the cleaning is usually done on sundays. the fridge inside the room was handy. the kitchen was always a bit busy and there were not enough cutlery, dishes, and kitchen utensils to cook. although we intended to cook, we ate out throughout our 4-day stay in the end. the bathrooms were not the cleanest ones in the world but were decent. we never met the host and the hostess but received enough information to get into the house. it was also very easy to find as it was only 3 min walking from the train/metro/subway station. one side note is that the house is right on the side of a big street and the isolation of the house is insufficient. if you are a light sleeper like me you might find it difficult to sleep as you can hear everything from other rooms and especially the noisy traffic. also, the curtains and blinds were white and transparent so in summer it gets bright really early.

the space is air conditioned and very comfortable.  the common space was perfect for our group of three couples to be able to relax and chat without utilizing one of the sleeping rooms. having the exclusive access to the cupula was really special! 

the location is great - with shops and food just a 5 minute walk down the street.  we enjoyed a late night walk for some ice cream.  parking was also a breeze, even with vehicles.

everything about this listing! m is a great host who arranged for me to have easy and flexible access on my arrival. you know how when you travel you always feel great getting back to your own shower? well, i got home and immediately missed this shower - it is tall with great pressure. i enjoyed the many dining options in back bay so i didn't really utilize the kitchen but very much appreciated that a brita water pitcher was available for me. it looks *just* like the photos and m even left out some sundries in the bathroom had i forgotten any. the listing has 'small' in the title but it isn't overly small and was an advantage during the week of heat that the air conditioning could get the space down to temperature without having to leave it running while away. also, this place is only about four blocks from cheers. yeah, that cheers. also, it is an easy walk to catch a game at fenway park in the other direction. i also made it down to the museum of fine art (free on wednesday night!). this was my first visit to boston and i loved staying at this central location with the many parks. you're here because you appreciate the shared economy that we live in, well, boston has both uber and lyft as well as hubway, short term one-way bike rentals with stations all over town.
m provides a clean space with a comfortable bed and a great shower. pretty much everything you could need!

reputation let host property airbnb ,"we booked this for four people and it was clearly described as having two separate beds (see reservations). it was also clearly described as being for 4 people.

when we arrived there, the apartment was clearly for only 2 people. no second bed, no sofa bed.  we contacted flatbook and they indicated it was their mistake, and we were entitled to a full refund, with no cancellation fees. 

we left on the same day, july 21st, about 1 hr after we got in, and we found another solution for our stay in boston. we put the key back in the keylock.

needless to say, this was a major problem which i never had before with any airbnb reservations.  extremely disappointed, as we planned our entire vacation around staying in backbay

on top of that, i didn't hear anything back from flatbook about getting a full refund.

flatbook indicated they swapped the sofabed  with a sofa the day before our arrival. now, this is a backbay 4th floor with no elevator. the two sofa look identical in the pictures so this explanation doesn't seem right .

we expect a full refund as it was promised by the flatbook team on the phone (maya and olivia).

i highly recommend *not* to book from flatbook in the future. certainly we never will do it again. i am surprised that airbnb that has such a good reputation, let them host properties on airbnb.

we were told to help ourselves to whatever was in the fridge, and they even went out of the way to make muffins for us(delicious!)

secondly, the room and board. 

the house is old but very well maintained. there is a sense of history that is almost palpable. the room was big and had most things you could possibly need, the only exception being a tv, but honestly, to us it was no loss. the bed was big and comfortable and the ambience made us feel relaxed.

finally, the location.

the house is very well located, 5-10min from the mbta station. downtown and most of the attractions are within a 30 minute journey. the neighborhood is quiet, safe and welcoming.

all in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.

the carney family's house in dorchester, boston. it was the grand finale of our honeymoon trip. the victorian-style house (from 1840, i think) is beautiful and very roomy. our room was cozy and comfortable, with free use of bath robes and slippers. at the time of our stay we were the only guests in this part of the house, so we had a full apartment with living room, fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and a back porch all for ourselfs. there were orange juice, bagels, fruits, fresh coffee and selfmade muffins for breakfast. also the location was just perfect. you can take a walk along the bay and the subway station is just a 5-10 minute walk away. the red line takes you in just 15 minutes to downtown boston and with only one transfer to the airport. very easy!
on our stay we met our host barney, his son john and his neighbor karen, who were all very friendly and helpful. if we return to boston sometime, we would definetly stay again at the carney family's house. this place gets an a+ from us and is highly recommended!!!",324.2736707,1,1

it was my first time sharing a washroom, and while it is not my personal preference to walk through a common area to get to one, there were no issues and it was available when i needed it.

i never actually met my host barney, though he was incredibly helpful in our messages. he provided plenty of directions and was proactive in contacting me. i did briefly encounter mary, who had a rather loud speaking voice, but who was very friendly.

it was perfect for me as i appreciated the privacy of my bedroom, but the common area, including the living room and the well-stocked kitchen with delicious breakfast items. mary's home-made granola and barney's home-made breakfast muffins were most delicious.

overall the apartment is as pictured, however it is not well maintained.  for example holes in the wall have been patched- but not painted over, the towel rack in the master bathroom was broken- small things like that. while not a big deal, for $570 a night i'd expect a bit more. also you have until 11am to leave the apartment. at 10:30am on departure day, 2 maintenance guys came by claiming they needed to caulk around the shower. i said asked if they could come back a little later because i was getting dressed and finishing up. they seemed kind of insistent and as a single woman alone in the apartment- it made me feel uncomfortable. luckily i wasn't around for much longer.

available premise price could arranged concierge desk upon arrival learned payment possible check money order wich dont always travel let say convenient payment method known would prepared wouldnt trouble park car despite 2 downside really great trip apartment fitted need everything else,"mike was very nice, available and flexible upon my inquieries. the checkin information and procedure is very precise and easy to follow. it is a very good location; the neighborhood is beautiful, calm and pretty close from everything by walk (restaurants, bars, other neighborhoods). 

the only downsides are:
1- thought we would have the apartment for wich i had read the listing, for wich i inquired about, and for wich i made the reservation, but it was not. the description said there were a fireplace, 2 double beds and 1 sofa bed, and that was perfect for us since we were two couple and one single person. i even inquired especially about the bed for the fifth person, so i expected to have the appropriate beddings. finally, the apartment we had, had no fireplace, and only 1 double bed, but 2 single beds and 1 single bed in the footrest (not a sofa bed) wich was not confortable at all for the fifth person. plus, there was extra single bed sheets, but no cover for the fifth guest. we made the best of this situation, but for 3 people out of 5, the bedding arrangement was not very confortable; and that was not what was expected according to the price we paid...

2- to my opinion, it would really help visitors if the parking information and procedure were added to the listing. we were told parking was available on premises, for a price, and that all could be arranged at the concierge desk. upon arrival, we learned that the payment was only possible with a check or a money order, wich you don't always have on you when you travel... let's just say it is not very convenient as payment method, but if we had known, we would have been prepared and we would'nt have been through all that trouble just to park the car.

provided visit covered everything needed location corporate housing situation great family 5 unit picture apartment layout unit appeared little dated picture good centrally located everything youd want visit boston every uber ride le 20 walking distance grocery store clean apartment arrived everything worked well enough shower water pressure washer dryer okay oven microwave worked etc safe neighborhood quite building couldnt hear anyone else could improved building older building show small issue wouldnt want deal shorter stay example door bathroom master bedroom wouldnt close hinge fallen toilet didnt flush well caulk shower come unit looked like needed handyman spend day fixing little odds end supposed security guard entrance saw twice 6 day overall good experience u accomplished needed would recommend rental yes would use probably ,"i didn't speak with mike at all.  the directions provided before our visit covered everything we needed.  the location is more of a corporate housing situation.  great for our family of 5.  we did not have the unit in the pictures but our apartment had the same layout.  our unit appeared a little more... dated than the pictures.  

the good:
centrally located to just about everything you'd want to visit in boston.  every uber ride was less than $20.
walking distance to a grocery store.
clean apartment when we arrived.  everything worked well enough (shower had water pressure, washer and dryer okay, oven and microwave worked, etc.)
safe neighborhood.
quite building, couldn't hear anyone else.

could be improved:
the building is an older building and it shows.  there were small issues that you wouldn't want to have to deal with during a shorter stay.  for example: the door to the bathroom in the master bedroom wouldn't close because the hinge had fallen.  the toilets didn't flush well.  the caulk in the shower had come off.  the unit looked like it needed a handyman to spend a day there fixing little odds and ends.  there was supposed to be a security guard at the entrance who we saw twice in the 6 days we were there.

overall a good experience for us and it accomplished what we needed.  would i recommend this rental? yes.  would i use it again? probably not.

noise car train highway outside ,"i had a great experience with my 1st airbnb experience at this compass apartment at 1085 boylston st., boston. during booking, adam answered to my inquiries very promptly. the check in process was smooth & easy, and the staff whose name is cristiane is very friendly & helpful. i stayed there for 10 days with my son after his knee surgery for recovery, we stayed inside the apartment most of the time and it feels like home. the apartment was very clean and neat like new when we checked in. the furniture, bedding, and utilities in the kitchen and bathroom are all very new. there is a tv in the living room and the bedroom, which comes with cable and a dvd player. iron & ironing board, vacuum cleaner & hair dryer are provided too. the bed was fairly comfortable, however since it is beside a highway, you do hear cars and trains passing by; it didn’t bother me and my son, but it might be a slight problem if you are an extremely light sleeper. the bathroom came with everything needed including towels, shampoo & soaps. the kitchen utilities provided are definitely enough to cook most meals. they are very thoughtful to provide kitchen towel, washing sponge, washing soap & dishwasher detergent. there are multiple washing machines and dryers in the building for use. overall the apartment felt very homey and has everything you need to live in for long periods of time. i parked my car in the basement parking lot with a $20/day fee, a good deal! the location is great! there are plenty restaurants right across the street, and more with a 5 to 10 minute walk down boylston or newbury street, prudential center is 10 minutes away. supermarket & pharmacies are all within walking distance.

to conclude: great location! extremely homey, and has everything you need. but it might take a day or two to get used to the noises from the cars and trains on the highway outside.

,"location, location, location. this describes both the good and the bad about this apartment. the good is that the apartment is conveniently within walking distance to plenty of restaurants, fenway park, newbury street, hynes convention center, and subway station. we liked how late-night food options were right across the street. the bad about the location is that it's situated right next to the highway and train tracks. our particular unit, #104, was on the first floor directly facing the highway and tracks (not overlooking lively boylston street as seen in the description photos). the cars passing on the highway were not that bothersome but the sound of the train and its vibrations were. in fact it woke up our 10-month old baby each time it passed during the night because the rumble could be felt. perhaps higher units or units facing the street do not have this problem. if i had known, i would've definitely requested a different unit. that problem aside, everything else was fine. the place was clean and well-stocked, although a few extra towels and back-up toilet paper roll would be nice. we received one roll for the 3 of us for a one week stay. the concierge did give us additional rolls when requested, but it's kind of inconvenient when you find out there's no backup when you need one the most. free laundry and detergent was a nice touch. concierge was extremely nice and helpful. i would stay at this apartment again, but would probably ask for a different unit.

neighborhood, listing is as it says, toiletries and other random items are in the bathroom for use, host responds in a timely manner, cheap parking at train station across the street ($5 a day)

the not so good: don't plan on watching any tv. there are limited channels and even those cut in and out every few seconds. there is no cell phone service in the studio and the wifi wasn't working for half my stay (though i will say gavin was very accommodating in trying to get that up and running), the shower drainage is poor and there ends up being a pool of water by the end, there was little spots of mold on the shower curtain, no free street parking except on weekends

how i travel from now on! i loved the location and have realized you get so much more from being immersed in the local culture as opposed to being insulted within the confines of a hotel. the location of this brownstone apartment could not have been better for feeling like a bostonian. although it was an older building, the proximity to newbury street, (the equivalent of rodeo drive in boston) the boston library, and boston commons park was fantastic! the room was comfortable and the kitchen well stocked with equipment. what impressed me the most, however, was jason's concern for my comfort. he let me know before i arrived that the air conditioner had broken–and, with a freakish heat wave hitting boston that week, he had to order the replacement online. a member of jason's team was waiting for me (and the air conditioner) when i checked in and had it set up shortly thereafter. jason followed up more than once to make certain i was cool and comfortable. the point i'd like to make is that a good experience doesn't mean that everything went perfectly. a good experience is when a potential problem is handled in an effective and timely manner, as was the case here. i would definitely stay

appt itself is well equipped.  there are a few things that are annoying about the place but jason responded to our issues very quickly  and has promised to look into them.  the main issue is the noise from other apartments ( this appt is the basement floor with other appts above it) , we think when using the shower.  this noise woke us up each day between 4 & 5 am, and we are not light sleepers at all, but this did disturb our rest.

the good: 

-location! tons of restaurants and shopping nearby. the copley station is about a 5 min walk. 
- the place was clean and had all of the necessary amenities. 
- the bed was great.
- the water pressure in the shower is amazing.
- the portable ac unit kept us comfortable at night. it was hot when we visited!

the not so good:

- the place is pretty small, but was fine for the two of us.

we arrived just after the former guests have left. since we would be gone for the day, we figured, he would clean the place during the day. but when we came back late at night, the bathroom especially was still very dirty. after we called him the next day, he cleaned it.  
the whole place is as minimalistic as it gets. there is one air mattress (not very comfortable) and a cupboard in each bedroom, a table and chairs in the living room (no couch), one empty spare room, the small bathroom and then the kitchen, which is not very clean, either. we did not use it.
the place could use some renovating and is not homey at all. if you are only looking for a place to crash, this may be fine. boston is expensive and maybe this is what you get for $177/night. 
we would definitely not book it again, although jordan was really friendly and helpful with tips for the area. 
and yes, it is very close to the airport mtb station. you can walk there in a few minutes.  ",-360.816842,0,0

jeff is very responsive to all our questions and requests. the information packet that had been left for us had a summary of all the attraction and dining options in the area, as well as how to get around using the public transport. it also had clear contact information if we had encountered any problems. 

some things to note. while generally quiet, there were a few instances where we could hear people shouting from the streets at night so this might be a problem for some. also, there is ongoing building construction across the street - workers would be able to see into one of the bedrooms. this wasn't a problem for us since we stayed over a weekend. parking might also be a problem but jeff would be able to point you to a few options in the neighborhood.

一切陈设用具都是宜家(ikea)新购的,非常齐全,风格也很有品味。舒适的大床让我能快速进入梦乡。厨具非常齐全,我甚至还为家人做了两天的早餐。jeff贴心的为我们在壁橱里准备了各种冲饮,咖啡、红茶。其中还有我最爱的川宁红茶(twinings),还有2种口味供我选择,真是太棒了!

房东jeff有一组非常专业的服务团队,让我们在晚上11点也能顺利入住。jeff的团队还贴心的为我们加了一张儿童床,让我的小侄女有了2个美妙的夜晚。公寓里一切都非常整洁,甚至就连摆放在床头的洗漱毛巾和香皂都摆放的是如此的整齐。这一切都让我觉得非常开心,服务团队真的非常专业。

our two grandchildren for their first trip to boston.  the condo is nicely-appointed with two comfortable bedrooms and a full-size, modern kitchen and and a bath off the hallway for easy access from both bedrooms, so it allowed all of us to have some privacy.  also, all the conveniences are there - i especially appreciated the coffee supplies, and we could easily have cooked full meals there to save money.   but, as other reviews have noted, the biggest plus is its location - literally just a few short blocks to the boston commons & gardens, the beginning of the the freedom trail, the old state house, faneuil hall, and an easy, if slightly longer, walk to the north end.   and, it is just steps from almost any subway line you might need to get to points west, cambridge, the airport, south station - you can go anywhere you need from here in almost no time at all.  if you are looking for a pleasant, safe alternative to the sky-high hotel rates in one of the most coveted areas for sightseeing in boston, this is the place!  would go back in a heartbeat if i ever need to return to the area for a while.  also, key exchange was a breeze.  thanks to the owners for making this place available to our family for what might have been an otherwise unaffordable trip for our family!

5 though we did not meet him personally. his apartment was great, as described, clean and perfect for a family. the only drawback to the apartment it that is in a pedestrian zone. which is not a problem if you arive via taxi, but if you arrive with a vehicle and are not familiar with boston streets and traffic, both the key exchange and parking are a challenge. the gentleman that met us with the key went out of his way to meet us at a street corner nearby where we could stop for a minute without being harrassed by the police just getting there was a challenge. he recommended we park in a garage at 33 arch st. it was probably the closest garage and was walking distance, but a total rip off! we ended up paying $71 for less than 24 hrs in the garage. according to the garage attendant the day starts over at 5am. had we not pulled into the garage until after 5pm it would have been $10 for the overnight until 5am then hourly after that! recommend not arriving at jeff's until after 5pm if you have a vehicle, but most importantly avoid the garage at 33 arch.

we didn't get to meet jeff personally, but the check-in process was really simple. jeff uses a company that sends someone to meet you with the key at the agreed upon time. our flight ended up being delayed, and then delayed further, and then delayed again...i was in touch with the company throughout and they were extremely understanding and accommodating, even when our final arrival time was pushed back to after 10pm. 

the only small downside is that as there is a building being constructed across the street, the front bedroom gets a pretty early wake-up call due to the construction. i recommend putting the lighter sleepers in your group in the other room!",-70.38884032,0,0

the key pick handover was a bit confusing and required a lot of communicating/effort on our part and when we arrived one of the bedrooms had a slight but bothersome smell of cigarette smoke, which lingered there for most of the visit.  i communicated all of this with jeff and to his credit he was very responsive and accommodating. he offered to send a caretaker to clean the place but by that point we were most of the way through our visit and decided to just clean the room ourselves. honestly, i think this was more of an issue with air bnb service/handlers. on the place itself - the place is as described and in a convenient location. i will say that the walls are pretty thin so one can easily hear noise from other tenants. not the biggest deal for me as i am a deep sleeper but bothersome for my friend. 

overall ok visit and while we would not stay here again i would say that the fact that most of the reviews are positive means that we likely had some bad luck. again, jeff is great and i am sure he is working to ensure that the issues we had will not happen with other guests.",-481.732483,0,0

the bathroom new and clean, well equipped. there's even a first aid kit with necessary details. 
the great advantage of this apartment  is washing machine and dryer. do not waste time going to laundry!
we were a little scared of information about parking: ""the closest parking  it's valet-parking at the airport."" but it turned out a lot easier! there is a great simple cheap  parking at the nearest metro station.

needs.  sara was warm and welcoming and had many little extra goodies available, such as granola bars and specialty coffees.  it was very quiet because the bedroom suite is in the basement and towards the back.  the only negative was that the stairs down are a bit steep and fairly tricky to manage with suitcases, but sara did offer to help.  the best part for us was the use of her washer and dryer so we could have clean clothes when we got on the cruise ship at the end of our stay there.  the other perk was the italian express pizzeria just around the corner.  they have an extensive menu, not just pizza, and everything we had (2 nights we ate there) was delicious, with huge servings.  share a salad and an entree and you will be full!  the subway stop at maverick square is very convenient, and getting a pass makes it all very easy - you can get everywhere on the subway.  we also did 2 walking tours using free tours on foot, and they were so excellent.  all you do is tip at the end.  look at their tours online.  we also enjoyed the sam adams brewery tour, with 3 big beer tastes at the end - free.

luckily able stow baggage hallway otherwise walking around would bit tetri game also parking easy especially snow prepared circle block couple time plan staying late feedback easy keep tile floor clean world outside covered snow best clean hopefully cause much extra work sara,"sara's suite provided a great home base for myself and a colleague. we were in boston on business and stayed 3 nights. sara was extremely welcoming and kind. she showed us all the amenities of the bedroom, and even suggested great spots in boston for photography. the room also featured a well-organized binder filled with information, sights-to-see, etc. in sum, sara is a very prepared and knowledgeable host with a passion for boston.

in terms of location, sara's home is great. down the street is a park on the water with an incredible view of downtown boston and the north end. we spent a good amount of time here collecting timelapses. the drive into boston proper is maybe 10-minutes. just try not to get lost on boston's collection of bridges, tunnels, and overpasses.

a couple of moot points for us were the size of the room. when the sofa bed is out, the room becomes a bit tight. add 2 people and 4 pieces of luggage, and you are in for a squeeze. luckily, we were able to stow some of our baggage into the hallway. otherwise, walking around would have been a bit of a tetris game. also, parking is not easy (especially in the snow). be prepared to circle the block a couple times if you plan on staying out late.

my only other feedback for myself. it's not easy to keep the tile floors clean when the world outside is covered in snow. we did out best to clean up after ourselves. hopefully, we did not cause too much extra work for sara.",54.23622077,1,1

comfortable.  sara had a great supply of coffee and  instant oatmeal for is and the fridge and microwave came in handy. 
our walk from maverick station was 5 minutes max. so convenient to get everywhere on the subway. 
our first meal was at italian express which one block up and over. tripadvisor said it was the #10 place to eat in all of boston!  it was super good and affordable. and they deliver!

one thing to note is that the stairs to your room are very narrow and steep. neither of is had a full size suitcase and it was a good thing. maneuvering our bags down and then up the stairs was the only challenge of our stay.

we met sara later that evening, she was very friendly and welcoming. the apartment is lovely and clean and very convenient for boston (one stop away on the subway - which is only a short walk from the apartment) and there are local shops nearby if you need anything.  however, we only needed milk as sara  had thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable.  
you must visit the local park which is a few minutes walk away from sara's, as the view of boston's skyline is amazing!  (nb the park was closed after 10pm).  sara also let us leave our luggage after check-out as we had an evening flight.  
we found the neighbourhood and apartment very quiet would recommend staying at sara's.

sara is prompt, responsive, polite and helpful, especially for a short notice request. the location is great, close to the t and the airport, in a safe neighborhood.  the description is spot on, but the furniture is in a slightly different arrangement from the photos.  the guest information book and the takeout menus were a lifesaver, as my husband and i arrived (easily by uber from the airport) past 1am and were starving! (the chinese dragon delivered exactly on time and was pretty tasty.)  the ""kitchen closet"" had flatware that the restaurant forgot to give us.  there's an extra sitting room with a futon and a basket with a ton of helpful tourist information.  we loved watching netflix on the roku while eating our late dinner.  sara has a fun, eclectic variety of dvds to choose from, too.  she provided us clean towels.  she leaves really easy, clear directions for everything, from checking in and out to switching the tv between roku and dvd modes.  all these little details make you feel like you're in a friend's home.

cons: when we finally settled in for bed around 3am, we pulled back the fluffy comforter to discover what looked like old sheets.  they looked like they'd been washed, but were severely pilled and discolored in some areas.  we ended up sleeping on top of the flat sheet, which looked clean and more crisp.  the room is chilly (which is probably great in the summer!).  we were provided an effective space heater but it was a bit loud, so it woke me a few times when it switched on throughout the night.

thank you for hosting us on such short notice and providing such spot on information for our first airbnb experience!",-545.7424705,0,1

check-in was uncomplicated; we connected via texting. the studio itself is a basement space with little natural light. it is otherwise as described - no frills, but it did the trick for my needs.
the bed was comfortable, the couch was aging, and something in the space triggered my allergies. no idea if it was cat hair, mold, or something completely different, but my eyes were watering and my nose stuffed up. i think around 5 am, the batteries of a smoke detector  in an adjacent room started failing, so i got a nice chirp for the rest of my night. it was also quite warm, but sara provided a big box fan that cooled things down.
overall, the experience was more or less what i expected and what i needed, since i was not looking for a luxury hotel.",-437.9412283,0,0

the studio is exactly what you see in the photos.  it is a basement apartment in an old historic building, super cute, and very different from the single story ranch houses that we have in texas.  the stairs were steep, so watch your step when you enter, but the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and there was coffee.  i would stay here if we were spending more time in boston!

the studio itself was nice, the pictures represent it well. my only criticism is that because it is a basement, there is a bit of a musty smell – but you get used to the smell pretty quickly, and it clears out once you let some air in, so this didn’t diminish our enjoyment of the apartment.

bother u way kind guest enjoysdesires interaction host probably isnt place ,"pros:
-close to airport and downtown, short walk to maverick square and blue line.
-check-in was fine, no delays or issues.
-laundry available (if you'll be staying for awhile).
-dvd player with 19"" flat screen. she has several dvds in the dresser below.
-k-cup machine, kettle, tea.
-fair number of toiletries available if you need them.
-water for shower/washing was hot.
-wireless internet was reliable.

cons:
-basement apartment, not much light or air circulation.
-to be honest, the apartment wasn't clean. at all. it was clear to me that she basically changes the sheets on the bed and that's about it.
-netflix worked intermittently. because it frequently stalled, it wasn't really usable. watching dvds was fine, however.
-water pressure in shower was pretty weak. it's going to take you a little longer to wash all the suds off your body.
-bath towels were damp upon arrival.
-fold-out bed in loveseat was not clean, so we decided not to use it.

the greatest advantage of staying here is the location. however, the space did not feel welcoming and frankly was a little disgusting. this apartment is really best for those who need or desire to be close to both downtown and the airport and do not plan on spending much time at the apartment, using it only as a place to sleep. if you enjoy relaxing at the end of your day in your room/apartment or want to do any of your own cooking, i'd avoid this listing. sara was thorough in her orientation and made check-in easy, but we did not see her for the rest of our stay. she also avoided making eye contact with us during check-in (perhaps just a nervous habit). this did not bother us in any way, but if you are the kind of guest who enjoys/desires interaction with your host, this probably isn't the place for you.
